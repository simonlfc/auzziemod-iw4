/*
	auzziemod REDUX
	jebus asked me to add a few things to the existing auzziemod, when I looked at the source (that I wrote) I wanted to throw up. so I rewrote it with the goal of matching vanilla IW4, and using as little base GSCs as possible

    also open-source because its time to give back :)
