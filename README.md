auzziemod IW4
==========

auzziemod IW4 is a rewrite of 71st Recon's decade old Modern Warfare 2 sniping mod.

Due to the upcoming mod-breaking deprecation of several functions in IW4x yet again for fuck knows what reason, you'll need to run a custom build of IW4x with the HTTP functions re-added to use them, or locally download the waypoints branch to your mod folder.
