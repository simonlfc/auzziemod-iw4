auzziemod IW4
==========

auzziemod IW4 is a open-source rewrite of 71st Recon's decade old Modern Warfare 2 sniping mod.

Previously always closed-source, I decided to open-source this one because there isn't much point keeping a trickshotting mod private anymore.

As always, auzziemod is designed to be as close to vanilla IW4 as much as possible, so it's a slightly harder experience compared to most sniping servers.

## Features
+ Custom controller-friendly menu layout
+ One mod for both FFA & SND
+ In-game loadout editor
+ 3 COD:OL snipers ported
  + L115A3
  + Cheytac M200
  + Remington MSR
+ Custom Intervention iron sight attachment
+ Doesn't replace any base game GSCs (hooks.gsc does replace some functions however)
+ Map Voting
+ Easy to use command system
+ Optional perfect Explosive Bullets, Save/Load/UFO commands
+ Custom Bot Warfare implementation
  + Uses remote CSV waypoints rather than GSCs (stored in waypoints branch of this repo)
  + Includes tool to convert old waypoint scripts
  + Support for gametype-specific waypoints
