auzziemod IW4
==========

auzziemod IW4 is a minimalistic open-source rewrite of 71st Recon's decade old Modern Warfare 2 sniping mod.

Previously always closed-source, I decided to open-source this one because there isn't much point keeping a trickshotting mod private anymore.

As always, auzziemod is designed to be as close to vanilla IW4 as much as possible, so it's a slightly harder experience compared to most sniping servers.

> ***This mod is only compatible with IW4x 0.7.0, yet to be released.***
